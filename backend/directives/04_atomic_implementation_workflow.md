> **STATUS**: MANDATORY OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL
> **ROLE**: STEP-BY-STEP ARCHITECTURE
> **MOTO**: "Perfect one brick before building the wall."

## The Golden Rule of Execution: "KINETIC & COMPLEX"
1. **NO MULTITASKING.** Complete one micro-task, verify it against all directives, then proceed.
2. **NO DRY TEXT.** Every word must be styled, animated, and part of a dynamic flow.
3. **COMPLEXITY IS QUALITY.** A 500-line HTML is junk. Every page must be rich, layered, and complex (1000+ lines of robust, semantic code).
4. **DOAEA Loop**: Mandatory for every single section.

## Phase 1: Deep Discovery & Asset Extraction
1.  **Full Recursive Scrape**: Run `scraper_website.py`. It MUST visit every single subpage without exception.
2.  **scrappedcontent.md**: 
    *   Create this file in the project root.
    *   Store 100% of the gathered text formatted in Markdown.
    *   **Final Entry**: Add a "Vibe & Analysis" section. List the strengths of the old site, its color palette, and key selling points to preserve in the new premium layout.
3.  **Categorical Asset Scrape**:
    *   Images must be saved and named based on their source (e.g., `origin_referencie_img_1.jpg`, `origin_kontakt_map.png`).
    *   **Zero Loss**: No image from the original site can be ignored.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Foundation & Global Branding
1.  **Project Shell**: Setup folder structure (`Frontend`, `Backend`, `assets`).
2.  **Global Tokens (`css/globals.css`)**: 
    *   **Custom Scrollbar**: Implement a branded premium scrollbar (no standard styles).
    *   **Typography**: Set high-end fonts and HSL color tokens.
3.  **Bilingual Foundation (SK/EN)**:
    *   Initialize the language dictionary. 100% of strings must be translatable.
4.  **The Header (Atomic)**: 
    *   Implement ONLY the header with original logo.
    *   **Interactive Switcher**: Working SK/EN toggle.
5.  **The Footer (Atomic)**:
    *   Implement ONLY the footer with 100% info inclusion.
6.  **Page Transition System**: Implement JS logic for smooth animations between sub-pages (Fades/Logo reveals).
7.  **Checkpoint 2**: Verify Header/Footer/Scrollbar/Transitions.

## Phase 3: Gradual Construction (Section-by-Section - KINETIC)
*Build sections, not pages.*

1.  **Intro Animation**: Implement a mandatory entry load (e.g., logo scaling) on first site visit.
2.  **Micro-Interactions**:
    *   **Mouse Awareness**: Elements must react to mouse movement (parallax/shifts).
    *   **Kinetic Hover**: Images must move or scale subtly when targeted.
3.  **Hero Section**: Use "Readability First". Analyze contrast. Execute kinetic animation. Verify.
4.  **Service/Value Sections**: Map data from Phase 1. Check for 100% text inclusion.
5.  **Cookie Banner**: Custom premium banner with dismiss logic.
6.  **Page Mapping**:
    *   Create Sub-pages only AFTER Global Header/Footer are verified.
    *   **Complexity Audit**: If a page is too short, expand it with more details and layers.

## Phase 4: 100% Functionality & Polish
1.  **Functional Integrity Check**: 
    *   Every button MUST have a result (Link, Scroll, or Toast notification). **Zero dead buttons allowed.**
    *   Check all internal links (`href="referencie.html"` etc.).
2.  **Readability Audit**: Scan every page. Ensure no image ever makes text hard to read.
3.  **Triple-Tier Verification (MANDATORY)**:
    *   **Desktop Audit**: Verify 1000+ line complexity and kinetic dynamics.
    *   **Tablet (iPad) Audit**: Verify touch ergonomics and adjusted grid layouts.
    *   **Mobile Audit**: Verify the independent mobile-first UI (Navigation, Spacing, Font optimization).
4.  **Dynamic Review**: Verify that animations make the site feel alive (Entrance reveals, hover states).

## Declaration of Completion
A project is only complete when the Agent can honestly say:
> "I have reviewed `04_Atomic_Implementation_Workflow.md` and every checkpoint is marked as verified. No data from `scrappedcontent.md` was omitted. The layout is premium and original."
